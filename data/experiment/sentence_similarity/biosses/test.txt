BAF53 and β-actin subunits have been implicated in mammalian SWI/SNF-regulated binding to the chromatin/nuclear matrix.
β-actin and actin-related proteins have been found in the various ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes
"With respect to LATS2, it has been reported that LATS2 induces G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death."
"The expression of miR-146a has been found to be up-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer  and cervical cancer."
The up-regulation of miR-146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues.
"Similarly to PLK1, Aurora-A activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation, including LATS2 and CDK5RAP2/Cnn."
The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine has been reported to down-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1
Recent work in model systems and acute myelogenous leukemia has suggested that expression of MCL-1 is a key determinant of resistance to ABT-737
"At the onset of mitosis, LATS2 is activated by phosphorylation and plays important roles in G2/M transition in cultured cells "
Lats2/Kpm is homologous to Lats1 and undergoes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation
"Ironically, Rest has recently been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene."
In human epithelial cells REST has been described as a potent suppressor of malignant transformation and its deregulation has been associated with several non-neural tumors including breast and small cell lung cancers
"Alterations in Oct-4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors."
"OCT4, a transcript of POU5F1, plays a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency, self-renewal and chromatin structure in stem cells, and promotes tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner."
"Three programs, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan , were used to predict the targets of miR-21."
The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm.
The recent reports demonstrated that the first eight nucleotides of the 5′ end of miRNA could correlate with the efficient translational repression.
Mismatches near the 5′ end of the small RNA completely abrogated translational suppression.
Oncogenic KRAS mutations are common in cancer.
"Notably, c-Raf has recently been found essential for development of K-Ras-driven NSCLCs."
